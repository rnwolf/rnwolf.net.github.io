 APIs form the building blocks of your software application.

API-based microservice architecture has risen in popularity due to the ability to build independent decoupled services that can be maintained, refactored and scaled easily.

highly reliable and scalable CRUD APIs is one of the fundamental requirements of core software engineering and will form the backbone of your backend system.

https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral
Spectral can be used as a generic ruleset engine on any JSON or YAML data, but was built with OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema in mind. Use Spectral rules to target API descriptions for quality improvement or enforce API Style Guide rules, such as naming conventions for OpenAPI models or prohibiting integers in URLs.

use the default OpenAPI or AsyncAPI rulesets, extend them, or create a ruleset to enforce your organization's API style guide. Or, export one of many style guides curated by us here and use it with Spectral.

Organizations large and small around the world have published their API Style Guides as Spectral Rulesets so they can distribute and enforce style guides across their entire organization, with some key examples being Adidas, Azure, Box, Digital Ocean, and the Italian Government many of which are published for you to try out, or at least use as inspiration.
