## My first computer and interest in tech

I grew up in South Africa [800km](https://zoom.earth/maps/radar/#view=-12.57,27.52,5z/date=2024-10-20,12:40,+1) up the coast from Cape Town, which is at the southen tip of Africa.

My first computer in the early 80's had 1KB of memory. <Image src={zx81} alt="ZX81 Computer" width="100" height="200"/>.

This lead me to spend hours and hours at the keyboard learning how to creating games. One good things lead to another and my school installed a computer laboratory full of BBC Micro computers. The technition installing them said that to really get into computers you needed to study electronic engineering.

# Cape Town

By the way did you know what Cape Town is the birth place for AWS? It was [Chris Pinkham’s](https://gadgeteer.co.za/chris-pinkham-south-african-who-helped-build-amazon-web-services-team-cape-town-engineers/), a director at Amazon, decision to move back to Cape Town from Seattle and Bezos who wanted to keep Pinkham on, that led to the founding the first non-USA development center. The Elastic Compute (EC2) service was born in Cape Town.

After I finished school and a gap year backpacking around Europe I started my engineering studies at the University of Cape Town. I loved it! <Image src={UCT} alt="UCT" width="300" height="200"/>.  I did a post graduate course in Finance and Accountancy.

How many of you work with teams that deploy you code to linux based containers? It is likley that it will be based on the Ubuntu flavour of linux, which was created by a chap call [Mark Shuttleworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth), who also hails from Cape Town.

# My first real job

After a few years at Siemens working in industrial automation.  Factory automation like car assembly lines and cement factories.

I started working at Internet startups. This was a crazy time.

This was when I started my first foray into Agile ways or working, 1998.

I worked on big content management systems, internet banks, digital marketplaces and other exciting projects. The London startup grew to 150 people with offices in UK, Germany and France.

# Intro to TOC

In 2002 I met my TOC mentor on a Life Coaching programme. Every since then I have been facinated by TOC, but unable to find any decent TOC work, I continued down my Agile career path.

# Agile Career

I've now worked in multiple programmes and organisations, usally with multiple teams, multiple suppliers, globally distributed with technical practices from brilliant to poor! Applying TOC where possible.
