Advice on how to think about Pulumi.

Resource Creation
o Modify the "Global Inventory List"
o Deterministically create resources

await feature.deplovFeatureService(featureServiceAras);

Inputs
o Stack references
o Current infrastructure state

const cluster = osoCtoudOutput(clusterName,region);

Configuration
o Inputs to resource creation
o More dynamic

const environment = feature. featureEnvironment(.....

Naming, Naming, Naming

o Changing resource names tells pulumi to destroy and recreate everything
o Name conflicts and length limits are a pain
o Figure out early which resources you'll reuse and name accordingly.
o <project>-<stack>-<region>-<resource> is a decent starting point, with more sub-components if you are deploying "per-<something_else>"
o Store your "base name" in a variable
o Have caller pass in a (short) namespace
