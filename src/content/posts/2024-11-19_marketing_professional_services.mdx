Hi All

Back to the landing page topic.

I was watching some YouTube videos and the following advent came up in my feed.
This was a paid advert. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rtp0U5axgc

I am travelling in South Africa so I assume that there are some location filter on the adverts.

This video advert linked to the following landing page.
https://co-foundry.co.za/salvage-software-development-ga/
With some additional fields to track the responses.
utm_source=google
utm_medium=cpc
utm_campaign=XXX
utm_content=XXX

They have a profile on LinkedIn
https://www.linkedin.com/company/co-foundry/posts/?feedView=all&viewAsMember=true

I am in no way affiliated to the company, but I was intrigues by the advert, landing page and was wonderting what might work for someone like myself.
Is there any point as a lone consultant in spending effort on marketing and branding like this company?
