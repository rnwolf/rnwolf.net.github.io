# This is another blog post


After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!


<Image
  src={myImage}
  widths={[240, 540, 720, myImage.width]}
  sizes={`(max-width: 360px) 240px, (max-width: 720px) 540px, (max-width: 1600px) 720px, ${myImage.width}px`}
  alt="A description."
  title="This is a title"
/>
