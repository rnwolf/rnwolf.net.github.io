## About me

Twitter: @rnwolf
Email: Rudi@rnwolf.net
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rudigerwolf/

Professionally I work with people and teams to transform ideas into valuable products and services. This usually includes technical development teams, because technology is often tightly coupled to the work we do.

## My Past

I was born to German parents in Johannesburg South Africa. Grew up in the Eastern Cape.
Started coding at young age on a computer with 1 KBytes on RAM, Sinclar ZX81.
Studied engineering at Cape Town University (UCT). During my military conscrition I worked as a developer at a reserach institute in Pretoria.

My first real job was with Siemens, Johannesburg, configuring and selling industrial automation controllers.
In 1996 I started playing around with the Internet, using early browsers such as Mosaic and Linux.

My first foray into Agile was in a fast growing Internet Service Provider.  To help organise the work and teams we used the Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM). After working on the most exciting project to build a financal news portal, I moved to cosmopolitan London, in the United Kingdom. In London I joined another dot-com start-up which grew into a professional services organisation with 150 staff and offices in a number of cities.

## Present

Digital Leadership - Agile Coaching - Helping teams to deliver valuable stuff and have a good time doing it!

Most teams I work with today use Agile and Lean approaches such as Scum, Kanban, XP & Devops. I try to avoid making a big thing about using Agile ways of working and concentrate on co-creating and designing ways of working that deliver results of all key stakeholders.
